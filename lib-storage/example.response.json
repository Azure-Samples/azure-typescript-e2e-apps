                "content":"TypeScript is an open-source, strongly-typed, object-oriented programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that is designed for large-scale JavaScript applications. TypeScript adds optional static typing, class-based object-oriented programming, interfaces, and modules to JavaScript, making it a more robust and scalable language. It also provides features like type inference, type checking, and auto-completion, which help developers in writing more reliable and error-free code. TypeScript code is compiled into plain JavaScript code that can be executed by any browser or JavaScript engine."
