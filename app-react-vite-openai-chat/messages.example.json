You may be able to find your answer at www.irs.gov/faqs”  \n\nChanges for 2022 that can affect tax refund: \n•\tChanges in the number of dependents, employment or self-employment income and divorce, among other factors, may affect your tax-filing status and refund. No additional stimulus payments. Unlike 2020 and 2021, there were no new stimulus payments for 2022 so taxpayers should not expect to get an additional payment.  \n•\tSome tax credits return to 2019 levels.  This means that taxpayers will likely receive a significantly smaller refund compared with the previous tax year. Changes include amounts for the Child Tax Credit (CTC), the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child and Dependent Care Credit will revert to pre-COVID levels.  \n•\tFor 2022, the CTC is worth $2,000 for each qualifying child. A child must be under age 17 at the end of 2022 to be a qualifying child.For the EITC, eligible taxpayers with no children will get $560 for the 2022 tax year.The Child and Dependent Care Credit returns to a maximum of $2,100 in 2022.\n•\tNo above-the-line charitable deductions. During COVID, taxpayers were able to take up to a $600 charitable donation tax deduction on their tax returns. However, for tax year 2022, taxpayers who don’t itemize and who take the standard deduction, won’t be able to deduct their charitable contributions.\n•\tMore people may be eligible for the Premium Tax Credit. For tax year 2022, taxpayers may qualify for temporarily expanded eligibility for the premium tax credit. \n•\tEligibility rules changed to claim a tax credit for clean vehicles. Review the changes under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 to qualify for a Clean Vehicle Credit."
