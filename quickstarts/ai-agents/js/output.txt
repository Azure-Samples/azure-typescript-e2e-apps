Text: Sure, I can help you solve the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\).

To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate \(x\) on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:
\[3x + 11 - 11 = 14 - 11\]
\[3x = 3\]

2. Divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{3}{3}\]
\[x = 1\]

So the solution to the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\) is \(x = 1\).
