Sure! To solve the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\), we need to isolate the variable \(x\).

Here are the steps:

1. Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:
\[3x + 11 - 11 = 14 - 11\]

2. Simplify both sides:
\[3x = 3\]

3. Divide both sides by 3:
\[x = \frac{3}{3}\]

4. Simplify:
\[x = 1\]

So, the solution to the equation \(3x + 11 = 14\) is \(x = 1\).Messages:
