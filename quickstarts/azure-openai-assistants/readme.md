# Azure OpenAI Assistants Quickstart

Use the Azure OpenAI Assistants client library to show how the assistant can generate JavaScript code for you.

* [Client library source code](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/tree/main/sdk/openai/openai-assistants)
* [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/openai-assistants)

## Environment variables

Two sets of environment variables are offered in the [sample.env](sample.env) which you should rename to `.env` when you use it. 

### Recommended: Passwordless with `Cognitive Services User` role

The first set is the recommended variables due to their security: 

```
# Used to authenticate using Azure AD as a service principal for role-based
# authentication.
# See the documentation for `EnvironmentCredential` at the following link:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/javascript/api/@azure/identity/environmentcredential
AZURE_TENANT_ID=<AD tenant id or name>
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<ID of the user/service principal to authenticate as>
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<client secret used to authenticate to Azure AD>
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<REPLACE-WITH-DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
```

### Passwords

The second set is only recommended for learning the SDK and isn't meant for development or production:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_KEY=<REPLACE-WITH-RESOURCE-KEY>
AZURE_OPENAI_RESOURCE=<REPLACE-WITH-RESOURCE_NAME>
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<REPLACE-WITH-RESOURCE_NAME>.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<REPLACE-WITH-DEPLOYMENT-NAME>
```

## Output

Sample output from this application is:

Message content: "The solution to the equation \\(3x + 11 = 14\\) is \\(x = 1\\)."
Message content: "Yes, of course! To solve the equation \\( 3x + 11 = 14 \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Subtract 11 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x.\n2. Then, divide by 3 to find the value of x.\n\nLet me calculate that for you."
Message content: "I need to solve the equation `3x + 11 = 14`. Can you help me?"
